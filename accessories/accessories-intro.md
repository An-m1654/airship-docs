# Accessories Intro

Accessories can be attached to the character by their bones (Rigid) or by weight painting (Skinned) . These could be clothing, face decals, weapons etc.&#x20;

Players customize their accessories through the Avatar editor, but each game can also overwrite characters accessories.

Characters have pre defined slots, and each slot can only have 1 accessory at a time. For example if your game forces a hat on a character, the players avatar hat will disappear and be replaced. The current slots can be seen in the dropdown on AccessoryComponent
